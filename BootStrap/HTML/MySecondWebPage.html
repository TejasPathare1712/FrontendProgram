            Diwali - The Festival Everyone Knows
With happiness to all
And sorrow to none,
The festival of lights
Diwali has come.

The streets shine
With candles’ light,
The festive lamps  
To all delight.

Children are out
With crackers in hands,
The fireworks sound
like musical bands.

Elders exchange
Gifts and sweets,
With love each one
To other greets.

Triumph of good
Over evil it shows,
Diwali, the festival
Everyone knows.
